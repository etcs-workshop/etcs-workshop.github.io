# Workshop on Emerging Themes in Computational Statistics
__Dates: 19th (Wed) - 20th (Thu) February, 2020__\
__Location: The Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tachikawa, Tokyo, Japan__\
__Registration: This workshop is open to all &mdash; no registration required.__

### Outline
Computational statistics is a rapidly developing research field due to the increasing
high demand in analysing large and complex data in many areas of science. Motivated
by the recent innovations in efficient computational techniques for statistical
inference and a variety of computationally challenging applications, this workshop aims
to facilitate discussions amongst researchers working on different aspects of statistical
computations, and promotes new ideas in both methodological and applied directions.
